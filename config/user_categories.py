# Define ONLY your main category names here
# The system will learn from your data what items belong to each category
MAIN_CATEGORIES = [
    'Tables',
    'Chairs', 
    'Computers',
    'Office_Supplies'
]

# You can add more categories as needed:
# 'Monitors',
# 'Kitchen_Items', 
# 'Storage_Furniture',
# 'Lighting',
# 'Electronics'

# ✨ The magic: You only provide category names above ✨
# The AI will analyze your inventory data and learn:
# - What words indicate "Tables" (desk, mesa, masa, writing surface, etc.)
# - What words indicate "Chairs" (sandalye, silla, seat, ergonomic, etc.) 
# - What words indicate "Computers" (PC, bilgisayar, ordenador, laptop, etc.)
# - And so on for each category you define!

# No more manually defining keywords - the system learns from YOUR data!
